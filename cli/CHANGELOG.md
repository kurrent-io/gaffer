# @kurrent/gaffer

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 2675301: Republish the per-platform native packages with their compiled CLI binary and co-located runtime. 0.1.0 shipped those packages empty - `gaffer` exited with `native binary for <platform> not found` on every invocation. Same root cause as the runtime fix: a CI artifact-handling bug. Reinstall `>=0.1.1`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5b85426: Develop, test, debug, and deploy KurrentDB projections from the command line. Runs projections locally against the same JavaScript engine KurrentDB uses.
  - `gaffer init` - create a new project (`gaffer.toml`, `.gaffer/`, `.gitignore`).
  - `gaffer scaffold <name>` - add a new projection.
  - `gaffer dev` - run a projection against fixtures, an events file, or a live KurrentDB instance.
  - `gaffer info` - inspect projection details.
  - `gaffer config` - manage user-level configuration (telemetry, identity).
  - `gaffer lsp` - Language Server Protocol over stdio for editor integration.
  - `gaffer mcp` - Model Context Protocol server exposing scaffolding, validation, debugging, and the projection API to AI agents.
  - `gaffer version` - print the installed version.
  - Debug Adapter Protocol server for breakpoint debugging, wired up automatically by the [KurrentDB Projections VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kurrent-io.gaffer).
