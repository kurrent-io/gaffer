"@kurrent/gaffer": patch
---

`gaffer init` now creates only `gaffer.toml`. The empty `.gaffer/` directory and the `.gitignore` entries (`.env`, `.env.*`, `.gaffer/`) were speculative scaffolding: nothing in tree reads the directory, the gitignore patterns presumed too much about the user's project layout (e.g. `.env.*` would have caught `.env.example`), and `.gitignore` was being created even outside a git repo.
