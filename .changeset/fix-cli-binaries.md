"@kurrent/gaffer": patch
---

Republish the per-platform native packages with their compiled CLI binary and co-located runtime. 0.1.0 shipped those packages empty - `gaffer` exited with `native binary for <platform> not found` on every invocation. Same root cause as the runtime fix: a CI artifact-handling bug. Reinstall `>=0.1.1`.
