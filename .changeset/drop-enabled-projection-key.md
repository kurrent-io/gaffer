"@kurrent/gaffer": patch
---

Drop the half-implemented `enabled` projection key from `gaffer.toml`. The key was honoured by exactly one consumer (MCP's `list_projections` tool, and only as an output tag rather than a filter); every other path - `gaffer dev`, `gaffer info`, `gaffer manifest`, the VS Code lens - ran and listed projections regardless.

The TOML parser silently ignores unknown keys, so any `enabled = false` left in an existing `gaffer.toml` becomes a no-op rather than an error. MCP `list_projections` no longer tags disabled projections in its output.
