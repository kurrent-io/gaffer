The runtime now builds with `InvariantGlobalization` enabled, so error messages stay English regardless of the host machine's locale. Previously a non-English-preference machine produced partially-translated framework messages (for example `... не число is not a valid JSON value` instead of `... NaN is not a valid JSON value`). These read as garbled text and made string-based test assertions non-portable across locales. The ICU dependency is also dropped from the native binary.
