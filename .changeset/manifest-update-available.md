"@kurrent/gaffer": patch

`gaffer manifest` now reports `updateAvailable: "x.y.z" | null` alongside `version` and `commands`. The value is sourced from the existing once-per-day update-notifier cache, so manifest fetches add no extra network call. Editor wrappers (the VS Code extension) can surface a one-click update toast without re-checking the npm registry.
